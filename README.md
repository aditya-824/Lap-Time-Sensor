# Lap-Time-Sensor
Arduino UNO based lap time sensor for 2025 prototype

## V1
- Basic pulse-activated timer that sends timed value to Blynk web dashboard

## V2
- Measurement of multiple lap times, yet to made consecutive
- Timer made resettable via Blynk virtual pin

## V3
- Integrated ultrasonic sensor
- Distance based threshold selected for detecting car
- Lap timing made consecutive
- Dropped Blynk functionality
- Calculating highest & lowest lap times

### Implementations Left
- Button based sensor power; allows for random object to be left undetected until before car passes through
